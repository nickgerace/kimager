`kimager` is a service that logs the existence of container images in a Kubernetes cluster.
Container image "existence" is determined by pod creation and deletion events.
Container image "loggging" involves using the [log crate](https://crates.io/crates/log) to record the timestamp, log level, and a message indicating what image is new to the cluster, or is no longer being used by any pods in the cluster.

## Installation

Clone the repository, and `cd` into it.
You can change the namespace name to whatever you prefer.

```bash
helm install -n kimager-system --create-namespace --wait kimager ./chart
```

You can also set the log level with `--set logLevel`.
This sets the `RUST_LOG` environment variable in the container (e.g. `DEBUG`).

## Usage

You can follow logs via the container's STDOUT within the pod. You may have to run the nested command (below) separately depending on your system.

```bash
kubectl logs -n kimager-system $(kubectl get pods -n kimager-system --no-headers -o custom-columns=":metadata.name") --follow
```

When reading or parsing the logs, reference the following format:

```
[TIMESTAMP LOG_LEVEL ] [ADDED_OR_DELETED_SYMBOL|RESOURCE_TYPE]  IMAGE_NAME:IMAGE_TAG  [POD_NAMESPACE|POD_NAME]
```

### Why not use labels to follow logs?

Using the label selector does not provide an up-to-date stream.
Following the logs of the pod itself is preferred.

## Uninstallation

Uninstall the helm chart and delete the namespace to return to where you started.
This will clean up all artifacts from installation and usage.

```bash
helm uninstall -n kimager-system kimager
kubectl delete namespace kimager-system
```

## Security Implications

This service aims to be as secure as possible, and it is able to `get` and `watch` pods at a `cluster` scope.
This means that information can be read (not written) from any pod in any namespace.
Please look at the [chart](./chart) for more information.

## Reaching "Stable" (Version 1.0.0)

The following prerequisites must be met before version `1.0.0` is released:

- [ ] Re-add unit tests
- [ ] Helm install without needing to clone repository
- [ ] GitHub action that runs `fmt`, `clippy`, `test`, and `build` on a Linux amd64 host
- [x] Publish a `latest`, and at least one "released" (e.g. `0.1.0`), Dockerhub image
- [x] Publish to crates.io (`0.1.0` tag first)
